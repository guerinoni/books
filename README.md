# books
Tracker for books I've read. Looking for suggestion and inspirational for others. :)

## Why this repo exists?

During years I love spending time to read books about tech industries, languages, databases and all around software engineering. This is a simple list of what I have read, looking for suggestions and maybe give some advice to other for a specific topic.

Can I do this on other platforms? Yes, google sheet, notion, obsidian and many other platforms can track this in different way, but I want to keep this public, for me, for forcing me to read more, and for others for taking a look on what I read. 
Does make sense to hold space for this? I think this simple file will waste very little space on cloud and out there there are worse things.

I would like to see different views of this list, like divided with tags or others... Looking for suggestion on how can improve this :D

## How can you help me or contribute?

Just opening a PR for adding more information about a book, year of publication, links, references, author in case I miss.
Do you want to see organized in specific way? Just ask.
Do you want to suggest a book? Open an issue :)

If you are looking for some sort of review I don't do it, I wrote a quick review on LinkedIn and Twitter when I finish a book for letting you know what I appreciated on that specific book at that time... You know, re-reading a book can change your thoughts :) sometimes happens.


## What about papers?

I'm thinking to track also some papers I read, but not all papers because sometimes I neither finish to read if I don't like. Maybe I can keep here some of those are very relevant for me or for CS. Hope you can suggest many of this category because I'm not a good scraper eheh.
